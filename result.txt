Their salsa is addictive and the cheese crisps are amazing. -
Oh also their beans and rice are top notch. +
The bean burrito I have been eating for 30 years is still the same awesome bean burrito. -
The Tacos are probaly the best i have ever had. +
It is a comfortable sit down place where you can socialize and not feel rushed.  +
So I placed my order and waited. +
It wasn't fantastic and wasn't awful. 0
Decided we try and get some Mexican food. +
I told the people up front and they brought me the one I ordered.  0
Yes, it's not the most authentic Mexican food and yes, it's a chain. +
It was dirty and the food basically sucked. -
The place is a dump, the workers are either idiots or rude. -
The prices are not cheap enough to warrant such crappy customer service. -
Just not spicy enough for us. +
The first chicken quesadilla was more annoying that harmful.  -
